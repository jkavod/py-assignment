1. WHAT IS A COMPILER?
   A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language.

2. WHAT IS AN INTERPRETER?

   An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without requiring them to be previously compiled into a machine language program

3. A] HOW IS A COMPILER SIMILAR TO AN INTERPRETER?

      Compilers and interpreters are both used to translate a program from a high-level programming or scripting language to machine language

   B] HOW ARE THEY SIMILAR?
      Compiler:
      1. Takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file

      2. The object code is also referred to as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking
      
      3. Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code

      4. Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code, but the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters

      5. Generates object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory

      6. Compiled code runs faster in comparison to interpreted code
      
      7. Displays all errors after compilation
      
      8. Based on translation linking-loading model

      9. Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++

      Interpreter:
      1. Directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code

      2. Translates only one statement of the program at a time

      3. Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code, but the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers

      4. No object code is generated, hence are memory efficient

      5. Displays errors of each line one by one

      6. Based on Interpretation Method

      7. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python, and Matlab


4. HOW IS COMPILED OR INTERPRETED CODE DIFFERENT FROM SOURCE CODE?
   1. COMPILED CODE:
      A. Is generated by a compiler from the source code
      B. Is expressed in the instructions of the target machine and is undecipherable by humans
      C. Is stored in a file and can be directly executed by the machine after linking
      D. Is optimized for the specific hardware and operating system of the machine on which it is intended to run
   2. INTEPRETED CODE:
      A. Is executed directly by an interpreter without previously converting it to an object code or machine code
      B. Is not expressed in the instructions of the target machine and is human-readable
      C. Is not stored in a file and is interpreted line by line
      D. Is not optimized for the specific hardware and operating system of the machine on which it is intended to run

5. WHAT DOES A PROGRAMMER USE TO PRODUCE PYTHON SOURCE CODE?
   A programmer uses a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to produce Python source code

6. WHAT IS NECESSARY TO EXECUTE A PYTHON PROGRAM?
   A. Python interpreter: The Python interpreter is responsible for executing the Python scripts
   B. Source code: The source code is written by programmers and is the foundation of any computer program
   C. Text editor or IDE: A programmer uses a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to produce Python source code

 7. LIST SEVERAL ADVANTAGES DEVELOPING SOFTWARE IN A HIGHER-LEVEL LANGUAGE HAS OVER DEVELOPING SOFTWARE IN MACHINE LANGUAGE

    A. Easier to write and maintain: High-level languages are designed to be easier to read and write, with a syntax that is closer to human language
    B. Higher level of abstraction: High-level languages provide a higher level of abstraction from machine languages
    C. Portability: Programs written in high-level languages are generally more portable, as they are not tightly bound to a specific hardware architecture
    D. Faster development: High-level languages offer built-in functions, libraries, and frameworks that expedite the development process
    E. Easy to learn: High-level languages are typically easier to learn for newcomers to programming, as they abstract away low-level complexities and allow beginners to focus on coding concepts and problem-solving
    F. Faster development: High-level languages offer built-in functions, libraries, and frameworks that expedite the development process
    G. Debugging is easy: High-level language makes it easier to write and debug a program and gives the programmer time to think about overall logic rather than thinking about program code


8. HOW CAN AN IDE IMPROVE A PROGRAMMER'S PRODUCTIVITY?
   A. Code editing automation: IDEs automate many coding tasks, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and refactoring support
   B. Debugging tools: IDEs provide debugging tools that allow programmers to examine different variables and inspect their code in a deliberate way
   C. Built-in libraries and frameworks: IDEs offer built-in functions, libraries, and frameworks that expedite the development process
   D. Collaboration features: IDEs support collaborative features that can help manage big projects
   E. Increased efficiency: IDEs provide shortcuts that let programmers cut down the time they need to do trivial things, such as compiling and executing code
   F. Simplified project management: IDEs simplify project management by providing an eagle-eye view of code, libraries, and associated files

9. WHAT IS THE "OFFICIAL" PYTHON IDE?
   A. PyCharm: PyCharm is a full-featured IDE specifically made for Python
   B. IDLE: IDLE is bundled with Python, so it could be viewed as the official IDE
   C. Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code is an open-source, cross-platform code editor from Microsoft with a ton of customization options and extensions
   D. Eclipse: Eclipse is a popular IDE that supports multiple programming languages, including Python
   E. Sublime Text: Sublime Text is a popular code editor that supports multiple programming languages, including Python

10. WHAT IS A STATEMENT IN A PYTHON PROGRAM?
    In Python, a statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. It is a standalone piece of code that performs a specific task or operation
